* The code performs the following actions: 
* Creates a path.
* Adds several figures to the path.
* Draws the path to the screen.
* Clones a copy of that path.
* Draws the new path to the screen.
* Notice that the call the Clone method must be cast as a GraphicsPath.

DO (LOCFILE("System.prg")) 

WITH _SCREEN.System.Drawing

* Retrieve the graphics object.
* Initialize the graphics object to be able to draw in the _screen
LOCAL loScreenGfx AS xfcGraphics

* Set several markers in a path.
