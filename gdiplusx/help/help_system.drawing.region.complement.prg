* The following code example demonstrates the use of Region.COMPLEMENT Method
* Creates a rectangle and draws it o the screen in black 
* Creates a second rectangle that intersects with the first and draws it to the screen in red. 
* Creates a region using the first rectangle. 
* Creates a GraphicsPath, and adds the second rectangle to it. 
* Gets the complement of the region when combined with the GraphicsPath. 
* Fills the complement area with blue and draws it to the screen. 
* Notice that the area of the GraphicsPath that does not intersect with the region is colored blue.


DO (LOCFILE("System.prg"))

* Retrieve the graphics object.
* Initialize the graphics object to be able to draw in the _screen
