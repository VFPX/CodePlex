** How to: Rotate, Reflect, and Skew Images
**
** Converted to GDIPlusX for VFP from .NET help:
** http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3b575a03.aspx
**
** The original image has been skewed, reflected, rotated, and translated. 
** The x-axis along the top edge of the original image is mapped to the line that runs through (200, 20) and (110, 100). The y-axis along the left edge of the original image
** is mapped to the line that runs through (200, 20) and (250, 30).

* Initialize the graphics object to be able to draw in the _screen

* Draw the image unaltered with its upper-left corner at (0, 0).
loImgGfx.DrawImage(loImage, 0, 0)

* Draw the image mapped to the parallelogram.
