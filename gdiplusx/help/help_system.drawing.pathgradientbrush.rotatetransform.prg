* The code performs the following actions: 
* Creates a graphics path and adds a rectangle to it.
* Creates a PathGradientBrush from the path points (in this example, the points form a rectangle, but it could be most any shape).
* Sets the center color to red and the surrounding color to blue.
* Draws the PathGradientBrush to the screen prior to applying the rotate transform.
* Applies the rotate transform to the brush by using its RotateTransform method.
* Draws the rotated brush (rectangle) to the screen.
* Notice that the bottom rectangle is rotated 45 degrees as compared to the one drawn prior to the translation.
