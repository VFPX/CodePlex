* The code performs the following actions: 
* Creates a rectangle and draws it to the screen in blue.
* Creates a region from the rectangle.
* Creates a transformation matrix and sets it to 45 degrees.
* Applies the transformation to the region.
* Fills the transformed region with red and draws the transformed region to the screen in red.
* Notice that the red rectangle is rotated 45 degrees from the original rectangle, shown in blue.

* Retrieve the graphics object.
* Initialize the graphics object to be able to draw in the _screen

loScreenGfx.DrawRectangle(.Pens.Blue, loRegionRect)

* Create a region using the first rectangle.

* rotation.

* screen in red.
