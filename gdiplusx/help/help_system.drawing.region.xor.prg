** Creates the first rectangle and draws it to the screen in black. 
** Creates a second rectangle and draws it to the screen in red. 
** Creates a region using the first rectangle. 
** Gets the Xor area for myRegion when combined with complementRect. 
** Fills the fills the Xor area with blue and draws it to the screen.
