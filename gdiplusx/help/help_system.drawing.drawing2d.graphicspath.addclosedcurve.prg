* The following code example demonstrates the use of GraphicsPath.Reset Method

* Creates an array of six points (representing a cardinal spline).
* Creates a path and adds the closed cardinal spline curves to the path (closed from the endpoint to the starting point).
* Draws the path to screen.
* Notice that a tension of 0.5 is used.

* Retrieve the graphics object.
* Initialize the graphics object to be able to draw in the _screen
LOCAL loScreenGfx AS xfcGraphics

* Creates a symetrical, closed curve.
