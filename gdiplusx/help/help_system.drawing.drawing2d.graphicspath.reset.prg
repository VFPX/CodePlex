* The code performs the following actions: 

* Creates a path.
* Adds several primitives to it.
* Draws the path's points array to the screen.
* Resets the path to an empty state.
* Re-acquires the points array (if it exists).
* Draws the array to the screen.
* Notice that it finds no array following the reset call.
