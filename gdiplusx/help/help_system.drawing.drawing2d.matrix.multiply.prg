* The code performs the following actions: 
* Creates three matrices.
* Lists the contents of matrix 1 to the screen.
* Multiplies matrix 1 by matrix 2 and stores the result in matrix 1.
* Lists the contents of matrix 1 to the screen.
* Multiplies the result stored in matrix 1 by matrix 3, and again stores the result in matrix 1.
* Lists the contents of matrix 1 to the screen.
* Draws a rectangle to the screen prior to applying the matrix 1 transform (the blue rectangle).
* Applies the transform to the rectangle.
* Draws the transformed rectangle to the screen (the red rectangle), using the same coordinates as the previous rectangle.
* Notice that the red rectangle has been scaled by a factor of two in the horizontal direction, then rotated 90 degrees, and then moved (translated) 250 points in the x direction and 50 points in the y direction.
