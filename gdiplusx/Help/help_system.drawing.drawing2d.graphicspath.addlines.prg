* The following code example demonstrates the use of GraphicsPath.Reset Method

* Creates an array of four points that describe a triangle.
* Creates a path and adds the array of lines.
* Draws the path to screen.
* Notice that each line after the first point uses the previous point as the starting point and the new point as the endpoint.

* Initialize the graphics object to be able to draw in the _screen
