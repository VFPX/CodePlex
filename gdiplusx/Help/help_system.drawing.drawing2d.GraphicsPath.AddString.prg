* The code performs the following actions: 
* Creates a path.
* Sets up string and font arguments.
* Adds the string to the path.
* Draws the string to the screen.
* There are two important things to be pointed out. First, notice that the fontStyle argument is cast as an integer. The AddString method requires this so that two or more FontStyle members can be combined to create the desired font style (in this case, Italic and Underline). Secondly, notice that the FillPath method is used rather than the DrawPath method. If FillPath is used, solid text is rendered, whereas if DrawPath is used, the text will be an outline style.
