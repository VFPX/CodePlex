* Creates a graphics path and adds a rectangle to it.
* Creates a PathGradientBrush from the path points (in this example, the points form a rectangle, but it could be most any shape).
* Sets the center color to red and the surrounding color to blue.
* Draws the PathGradientBrush to the screen prior to applying the multiply transform.
* Creates s matrix that rotates the brush 90 degrees and translates it by 100 in both axes.
* Applies this matrix to the brush by using the MultiplyTransform method.
* Draws the brush to the screen.
