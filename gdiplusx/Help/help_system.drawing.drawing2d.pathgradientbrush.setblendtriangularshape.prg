* The code performs the following actions: 
* Creates a graphics path and adds a rectangle to it.
* Creates a PathGradientBrush from the path points (in this example, the points form a rectangle, but it could be most any shape).
* Sets the center color to red and the surrounding color to blue.
* Draws the PathGradientBrush to the screen prior to applying the blend transform.
* Applies the blend transform to the brush by using its SetBlendTriangularShape method.
* Calls the TranslateTransform method to move the brush rectangle such that it does not overlay the one drawn to the screen earlier.
* Draws the transformed-brush rectangle is drawn to the screen.
* Notice that the maximum center color (red) is located half way from the center of the path to the path boundary.

* Initialize the graphics object to be able to draw in the _screen
LOCAL loScreenGfx AS xfcGraphics

DIMENSION myPathPointArray(mypath.PointCount)
FOR n = 1 TO mypath.PointCount

* Create a path gradient brush.
LOCAL myPgBrush as xfcPathGradientBrush

* Draw the brush to the screen prior to blend
loScreenGfx.FillRectangle(myPGBrush, 10, 10, 200, 200)

* Set the Blend factors.
myPGBrush.SetBlendTriangularShape(0.5, 1.0)

* Move the brush down by 100 by Applying the translate
* transform to the brush.
myPGBrush.TranslateTransform(0, 100, .Drawing2D.MatrixOrder.Append)

* Draw the brush to the screen again after applying the transforms.
loScreenGfx.FillRectangle(myPGBrush, 10, 10, 300, 300)
