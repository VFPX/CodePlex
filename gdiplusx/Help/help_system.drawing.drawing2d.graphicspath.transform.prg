* The code performs the following actions: 

* Creates a path.
* Adds an ellipse to the path.
* Draws path to the screen.
* Creates a transform matrix to translate the path 100 units in the x-axis direction.
* Draws the transformed path to the screen.
* Notice that the original ellipse is drawn in black and the transformed ellipse is drawn in red.



_SCREEN.AddProperty("System", NEWOBJECT("xfcSystem", LOCFILE("system.vcx","vcx"))) 

WITH _SCREEN.System.Drawing

* Retrieve the graphics object.
* Initialize the graphics object to be able to draw in the _screen
LOCAL loScreenGfx AS xfcGraphics
loScreenGfx = .Graphics.FromHwnd(_Screen.HWnd)

* Create a path and add and ellipse.
LOCAL loMyPath as xfcGraphicsPath
loMyPath = .Drawing2D.GraphicsPath.New()
loMyPath.AddEllipse(0, 0, 100, 200)

* Draw the starting position to screen.
loScreenGfx.DrawPath(.Pens.Black, loMyPath)

* Move the ellipse 100 points to the right.
LOCAL loTranslateMatrix as xfcMatrix
loTranslateMatrix = .Drawing2d.Matrix.New()
loTranslateMatrix.Translate(100, 0)
loMyPath.Transform(loTranslateMatrix)

* Draw the transformed ellipse to the screen.
