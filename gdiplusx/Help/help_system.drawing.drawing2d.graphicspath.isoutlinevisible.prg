** Converted to GDIPlusX for VFP from .NET help:
** http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms142540(VS.80).aspx

* Converted code from .NET to GdiPlusX VFP-X Foundation Classes
* http://www.codeplex.com/VFPX/Wiki/View.aspx?title=GDIPlusX&referringTitle=Home 

* The code performs the following actions: 

* Creates a path.
* Adds a rectangle to the path.
* Creates a wide pen and widens the path with that pen (to make the example clearer), 
* Tests a point (100, 50) to see if it lies within (under) one of the edges of the rectangle by calling IsOutlineVisible.
* The result is shown in the message box (in this case, true). In other words the edge is rendered over that point.

_SCREEN.AddProperty("System", NEWOBJECT("xfcSystem", LOCFILE("system.vcx","vcx"))) 

WITH _SCREEN.System.Drawing

* Retrieve the graphics object.
* Initialize the graphics object to be able to draw in the _screen
