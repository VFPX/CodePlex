* The code creates a graphics path and adds a rectangle to it.
* Creates a PathGradientBrush from the path points (in this example, the points form a rectangle, but it could be most any shape).
* Sets the center color to red and the surrounding color to blue.
* Draws the PathGradientBrush to the screen prior to applying the scale transform.
* Applies the scale transform to the brush by using its ScaleTransform method.
* Calls the TranslateTransform method to move the brush rectangle such that it does not overlay the one drawn to the screen earlier.
* Draws the translated brush rectangle to the screen.
* Notice that the bottom rectangle is twice as long in the x-axis as is the one drawn prior to the translation.
