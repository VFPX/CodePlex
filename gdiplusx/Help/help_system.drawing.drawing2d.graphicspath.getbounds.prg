** Converted to GDIPlusX for VFP from .NET help:

* The code performs the following actions: 

* Creates a graphics path.
* Adds an ellipse (circle) to it and draws it to the screen.
* Retrieves the bounding rectangle for the circle with a call to GetBounds and draws the rectangle to the screen.
* Creates a second graphics path.
* Adds a circle and widens the path to a width of 10.
* Draws the path to the screen.
* Retrieves the bounding rectangle for the second circle.
* Draws the bounding rectangle to the screen.
* Displays the rectangle size in a dialog box.
* Notice that the bounding rectangle on the right is larger (to account for the extra width of the line).
