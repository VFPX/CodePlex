*---------------------------------------------
* MemberDataScripting Tips
*
* If you do not begin your script with
* a PARAMETERS or LPARAMETERS statement,
* the statement shown above will be added
* during runtime execution.
*
* Parameters:
* -----------
* toFx          - a ref to the executing object
* toListener    - a ref to the running ReportListener
* tcMethodToken - an uppercase version of the 
*                 executing event, e.g. "BEFOREREPORT"
*
* Additional parameters depend on the executing event.
*
* If you use your own parameter statement with more 
* descriptive variable names, you must still include 
* the full set of parameters (through tP12), even if 
* you are limiting the events for which the script 
* will be executed.
*
* ExecWhen:
* --------------
* You can use any of the following values in ExecWhen
* to limit when this script is called. (Remove the 
* quotation marks shown here):
*
*    -- a single (case-insensitive) method token, 
*       such as "Render"
*        
*    -- an expression that will evaluate to a logical 
*       value, such as "MyApplication.IncludeScript" 
*       or "MyTable.MyLogicalField".
*
*    -- a "|"-delimited set of method tokens (case-
*       insensitive), such as "|BeforeReport|AfterReport|"
*
* ExecWhen is evaluated dynamically.  
*
* You can even change the expression being evaluated in 
* ExecWhen, or the script being executed, dynamically in 
* the script itself. These two items are held in a 
* read-write cursor (toFX.ScriptAlias) in the 
* ReportListener's FRXDataSession.
*
* ExecWhen is evaluated in the ReportListener's 
* CurrentDataSession, and script is executed within the 
* CurrentDataSession unless you change the session within 
* the script.
