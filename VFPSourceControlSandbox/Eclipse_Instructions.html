InstallTEE.htm are the instructions on how to add the Team Explorer Plug in to Eclipse IDE. Follow the instructions to attach the plug in to the iDE.<br>
Installation of the plug in forces a restart of Eclipse IDE.<br>
Once restarted, choose workbench from the initial screen.<br>
Note: Subsequent launches will ask for your workspace. If you have more than one, you will have to manage these folders yourself. (EG H:\Projects\VFPx)<br>
All projects will live under this folder. You can check the always use this folder box to stop the dialog from appearing.
<br>
<h3>To add a project from the IDE</h3>
Click File, Import<br>
From the Import list, expand Team and choose Team Foundation server and click Next<br>
First time only you will need to setup your account on the CodePlex Server
Click the servers button to setup the tfs server / username<br>
Click Add to add a new server.<br>
On the login detail tab, set the server to https://tfs.codeplex.com/tfs<br>
Set the authentication dropdown to "Authenticate using these credentials"<br>
Enter your Codeplex User name with an added "_cp" (no quotes, set the domain to snd and enter your password.<br>
<b><i>Important:</b></i>Dont forget to add the _cp to your username.<br>
You can change the Name of the connection at the bottom of the screen to something you will remember.<br>
Click OK to save.<br>
Eclipse will attempt to connect to the server, if successful you should see TFS01 in the Team Project Collections, and VFPx in the Team projects panes respectively.<br>
If not, close Eclipse and restart.<br>
Click OK<br>
After the first time, you will not see this dialog, Eclipse will use the connection information from the last time you connected to TFS.<br>
You may see the workspace selection dialog at this point. Simply select your TFS workspace now, or add a new one. You can have mulitple workspaces if you choose.<br>
Next, you should see a treeview with tfs.codeplex.com\TFS01 at the root and a first level node of VFPX.<br>
Below that, is the list of projects, highlight all the projects to join.<br>
You can check the "Perform a force Get" to have all the source files downloaded as part of adding the project, but it seems to get them on the Add anyway.<br>
Click Next to view the Confirmation dialog. You cannot change anything here, just click finish or cancel depending upon your desire. <br>
Clicking finish will add the project(s) to eclipse.<br>

The selected projects will be added to the projects pane of the IDE where you can now perform all source control functions on the project file(s).
